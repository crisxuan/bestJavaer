 ## Interview Question Series

 > The author hates the online interview question summary and other articles. It is nothing more than the fact that various Baidus took the first few sentences to fill the number. This practice of propagating memorization is the same as that of high school teachers teaching students to deal with exams. It is lucky and everything is fast.  The psychology of this has contributed to the impetuous atmosphere of the society.
 >
 > So the author is inspiring to help you understand each interview question from the root
